# InstanewsProject

###### In this project, I learn a lot of new stuff such as:
* Gulp
* JQuery
* Ajax, JSON and APIs
* Sass/CSS 
* CSS Grid
* Animation with CSS
* Web Accessibility
* Performance Test

###### I have a hard time to query data with Ajax but I slowly understood it a little bit now.

###### I tried to do a 3D flip card for news but I could not do it because all the card keep stacking up on the top of each other.
I also could not append information on the font and back of the card.

I like the project time line.  I think two weeks is great.  I have more time to play more with the project.  I think that one week
will be too short.
